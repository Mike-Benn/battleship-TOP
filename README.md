# Battleship Game

This is the capstone project in the JavaScript section of The Odin Project's curriculum.  We were to make a browser simulation of the popular Battleship board game.  A human player places their ships on the board, after confirmating a computer generated board is handled for the AI player and the game begins taking turns between the two players until a player is out of ships.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

This project made heavy use of ES6 modules and Webpack to build it.  The focus was heavily put on making factory function to handle the different objects at play with them being managed by a game controller and screen controller.   

## Optimizations and the Future

A few optimizations I would consider if I were to return to this project down the road would be:
  -  A main menu screen, instead of the player hopping straight into the game it would improve the presentation to have a menu screen with an assortment of options
  -  A scoreboard to track multiple repeated plays
  -  A more fleshed out AI where they are much smarter whether it be making educated guesses and responding intuitively that there's a nearby ship whenever they land a hit and follow up on that til the ship is sunk instead of randomly generating plays

## Lessons Learned:

I got a lot of experience with ES6 modules in this project.  This is one of the first big projects in the curriculum where we are importing and exporting many things and it was good experience on how you might want to structure your files whether it be their hierarchy or what's contained inside of them.
